#Challenges using the mtcars data set
{
# Beginner: 

# Fuel Efficiency Analysis:
#   
# Challenge: Write a function to visualize the relationship between the number of cylinders (cyl) and miles per gallon (mpg). Provide insights on which cylinder configuration offers the best fuel efficiency.
# Requirements: The function should create a boxplot or violin plot to show the distribution of mpg for each cyl category.

# Intermediate:

# Correlation Heatmap:
# 
# Challenge: Write a function to compute and visualize the correlation matrix of the dataset. Identify which variables are most strongly correlated with each other.
# Requirements: The function should create a heatmap of the correlation matrix, with appropriate labels and a color legend.

# Advanced:

# Car Performance Segmentation:
# 
# Challenge: Write a function or series of functions to classify cars into performance segments based on your choice of the available attributes. Visualize these segments in a scatter plot.
# Requirements: The function should use clustering (e.g., k-means) to segment the cars and then visualize the clusters in a 2D scatter plot (even if using more than 2 dimensions)

#Challenges using the Spotify music data set
#This data set is in the supplementary folder. Read it in like this
spotify <- read.csv('./supplementary/top10s.csv')
#Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leonardopena/top-spotify-songs-from-20102019-by-year

#Some details about the data set

#title: Song's title
#artist: Song's artist
#top genre: the genre of the track
#year: Song's year in the Billboard
#bpm: Beats Per Minute - The tempo of the song.
#nrgy: Energy- The energy of a song - the higher the value, the more energtic.
#dnce: Danceability - The higher the value, the easier it is to dance to this song.
#dB: Loudness..dB.. - The higher the value, the louder the song
#live: Liveness - The higher the value, the more likely the song is a live recording
#val: Valence - The higher the value, the more positive mood for the song.
#dur: Length - The duration of the song.
#acous: Acousticness.. - The higher the value the more acoustic the song is.
#spch: Speechiness - The higher the value the more spoken word the song contains.
#pop: Popularity- The higher the value the more popular the song is.


{
  # Beginner:
  
  #   Energy Levels Across Artists:
  #   
  #   Challenge: Write a function to analyze the energy levels (nrgy) of songs from different artists. Identify which artists consistently produce high-energy songs.
  # Requirements: The function should create a bar plot or boxplot showing the average nrgy for songs by each artist, highlighting those with consistently high energy.
